# Static 
Static was my first attempt at making a game in Unity for a final project in my game mechanics course. While it began as a group project, it quickly became a solo project as there was very little help from other members (a bit of the inventory system and enemy modeling was done by others). While the game itself does feature many bugs and a relatively confusing objects for a first time player, I still believe it was a good first attempt as it was done in less than a month for my first Unity experience.
